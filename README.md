Java Programming Intership


Task 1: Number Game
In this task, I am required to develop a simple number game using Java. The game will allow the user to guess the number, and the program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to implement efficient logic, ensuring an interactive and engaging user experience. This task wiil help me practise core java concepts like loops, conditions, and user input handling.

Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
In this task, I need to create a Java program that calculates the grade of a student based on their marks in different subject, The pogram will take input for each subject's marks, calculte the total and percentage and assign a grade (like A, B, C etc.) based on predefined grading criteria, This task will help me strengthen my skills in handling input, output, and logic-based decisions in java, using conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations. 

Task 3: ATM Interface
In this task, I need to design a Java-based ATM interface that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking account balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and exiting the system. This program will authenticate the user with a PIN and provide options for different transactions. This task will focus on implementing menus, user authentication, and transaction handling, exchanging my understanding of Java loops, conditionals and input/output handling.

Task 4:
